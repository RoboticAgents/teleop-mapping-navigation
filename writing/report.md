## Step 1: Getting Started and `teleop`

Step 1: Open the box for the robot and take out the dock. Place the dock on the floor in an open space and plug it into the nearest outlet.
Step 2: Power on the robot and plug the router into the wall
Step 3: Connect the computer's network to the router, ensuring that the robot connects to the router as well.
Step 4: Make sure that the robot has the keyboard control ros commands installed. If not, make sure to install them.
Step 5: Run the keyboard commands and watch the robot move when you type commands!

`source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash`
`ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard`

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

While completing the work on this assignment some challenges that we ran into were getting the network to work with our laptops and the turtle bot to get it to move. Another issue we ran into was saving our image of the map our turtle bot created. One more of the challenges that we ran into was getting our robot to move from the start point to the end point. We solved these issues as a group and ultimately got to our goal of having our turtle bot complete the task of moving from a start point to an end point. The biggest learning take away  

## Team Work

For our group our strategy is to work evenly and failry with thoughts of action leading toward our each individual strong suits. For the ultimate goal of getting our turlebot to create a map and complete a course with a start point and an end point.
